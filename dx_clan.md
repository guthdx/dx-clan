# DX Clan - Family History

Except that he came originally to the Upper Missouri as a Trader for the Columbia Fur Company, ca 1820, little is known of this man. Indications are that he was here probably ten, fifteen years earlier.

I believe he was the "delaCompte" that came for his own reasons to the Black Hills in 1833 with the five white gold stealers.

The last one to die, huddled in a gully, scratched a record of their attempted theft and consequent annihilation on the so-called Thoen Stone. "All ded but me ... (Indians) got our gold, June 1834 ... Indians hunting me."

There was an "Indian Crow" inscribed on that stone as a member of the 7-man party, almost certainly a Sioux man called Crow.

A Crow Indian would have to be about half insane to go into the Sacred Paha Sapa in those early times. Or maybe, that was just a scared white man's condemned way of inscribing Crow Feather.

LeCompte was allowed to live, I believe, because he was a brother, the husband of Pazaakuwin, probably a Yankton woman.

There is a difference in the family over whether she was a Sans Arc woman or a Yankton woman of the White Medicine Cow Band under Jumping Thunder.

She could have been a Sans Arc, as Sophie testified in a sworn deposition in 1910 that both her parents, Louisson and Lillian were half-blood Sans Arcs.

Reading her probate statements, great-grandma Sophie was an intelligent, mature mixed-blood woman. She would certainly know her own band affiliation!

On the other hand, the senior Mrs. LeCompte was undoubtedly the daughter of a very influential man, from whichever band, to rate a white husband of LeCompte's stature.

That would seem to eliminate any one of the headmen of the Sans Arc Band, since Louisson and Lillian had married and the band tiospayes were all near-related, and we are a matrilineal people.

Pazaakuwin probably had to come from some other band - but why the Yankton?

Joseph LeCompte lived out his years alone (with his gold?) in the civilization of the Big Sioux River area. He must be buried over there.

In 1840 he asked the Jesuits (the converters of beaver) to baptize his four children.

They were, along with Louisson, Theresa Latina LeCompte, 1832-1888 (Owen McKenzie, d. 1863, Antoine "Chet" DuBray, 1825-1901, Cuthbert DuCharme or Papineau, 1827-1903), John Baptiste "Battese" Lecompte, 1836-1878 (no issue) and Marie LeCompte or Hearing, 1838-1899 (Black Tomahawk, d. 1892).

DeSmet, a Belgian priest recorded them as the children of Joseph LeCompte and a "Sauvagesse," a French word meaning female savage.

This particular female savage was my paternal 3rd great-grandmother.

The only recorded child of Hearing and Black Tomahawk was Walking Crane, who was called Paul Dougherty, d. 1909 (Red Lodge Woman, Comes With Hail Woman). His children were:

With Red Lodge, William Dougherty, 1870-1916 (Jessie Banks, 1871-1894, Louisa Crow Eagle, 1874-1930), and with Comes With Hail, Leo or Tut Walking Crane, 1892-1962 (Lucy Brown Thunder, Edith They Like Him, 1898-1970), Joseph Walking Crane, 1894-1912, and Jennie Walking Crane, 1897-1964).

- Louis Ducheneaux, 1893-1893

### Henry Ducheneaux (1878-1936)

Henry Ducheneaux, 1878-1936, was the middle son of Napoleon and Sophie Ducheneaux. His wife, Nellie C DuBray, 1876-1920, was a former Red Sister of the Roman Catholic Church.

She married Henry on November 1, 1901, before a county judge in the little town of Bangor, across the river.

She died in childbirth and is buried along side Henry with her baby daughter named for her in her arms in the Ducheneaux Cemetery finally at Swift Bird.

His middle son, Ernest Lyle Ducheneaux, 1944, told me once that uncle Ernest Ducheneaux likened her to a Saint.

Her children:
- Frank Ducheneaux, 1903-1976 (Irene Robertson, 1901-1982, Helen Grover, 1911-1996, Millie Vereide, d. 1932, Ellen "Babe" Claymore, 1913-1981, Catherine Carter, 1922-1971)
- Edward Ducheneaux, 1904-1975 (Alice Oltmanns, 1909)
- Ernest "Tuff" Ducheneaux, 1906-1984 (Mary Collins, 1913-1987)
- Rita Pauline Ducheneaux, 1911 (Robert "Tiger" Thykeson, 1907-1990)
- Josephine "Henrietta" Ducheneaux, 1916-1945 (Stanley Nelson, 1912-1982)
- Nellie C Ducheneaux (who was born and died on her mother's birthday and is buried in her arms)

After the death of Nellie, Henry married Felecia Rivers, 1872-1966; she was the widow of George Vandervier, 1863-1926. We called her Grandma Felecia.

He made a deal with Felicia that they would be buried with their former spouses.

Henry Ducheneaux was a rancher, Dewey County deputy sheriff and a land-locator for the white homesteaders, after the forced Indian allotments, when the US Congress arbitrarily declared the remainder "surplus to our needs."

Later, in a 1915 letter to the Superintendent, he couldn't understand why "our white brothers" were getting 50 cents per acre for land burned by the railroad, while he and his sons and other Indians were only receiving 10 or 15 cents.

He lived in Trail City when it was still Cheyenne Junction and he suggested the new name.

Grandma Ducheneaux was a skilled mid-wife in the Trail City and Promise vicinities; she delivered many white and Indian infants in her time, under all conditions.

## Nellie C DuBray's Family

The title, "Grandma Ducheneaux," seems strange to me.

Her father and mother were Antoine "Chet" DuBray, 1825-1901, and the only known child of Julia Moran, 1849-1878. Julia died when Nellie was 2 years old.

She was the daughter of a white man, or maybe a breed (he looked like one) named Narcisse Moran, ca 1810, and Cheyenne Woman, 1831-1857. Moran's origins are unknown, but he was probably a Cree Red River half-breed.

Cheyenne Woman was an aunt of Helen Larrabee, the half-breed wife of Crazy Horse, 1842-1877. Helen was a daughter of a Cheyenne Indian woman and Joseph Larrabee, a brother to Alexander Larrabee of this reservation.

A grandson of Alex Larrabee's, Sullivan Larrabee, 1906-1984, told me one time he was closely related to my dad. (Sullivan, that was Gentle Ben's dad)

I think he was saying that Narcisse Moran and Joseph Larrabee had been married to the same Cheyenne Indian woman and I think he was talking about being related in the Sioux way.

On the other hand, the Sioux were closely allied with the Cheyenne and there were, no doubt, several wives named Cheyenne Woman by the Sioux and undoubtedly many of them were closely related.

## Antoine "Chet" DuBray (1825-1901)

Antoine "Chet" DuBray, a Free Trader from St. Ferdinand, Missouri, had four Sioux wives of record.

In his time though, he roamed the Rocky Mountains as far north as the Assiniboine River and as far south as the Arkansas River, so who knows! He was fluent in several of the native tongues.

He was serving one time, ca 1859, as an Arapaho interpreter for a white court in Denver. When he was called on to interpret, he was passed out in his chair. He must have liked his whiskey.

Witnesses reported that he went to war with the Arapahos in 1865 against the whites in retaliation for Sand Creek. He probably had lost a wife or two and some children in that particular massacre.

He died on the Big White River and is buried in the St. Francis Catholic Cemetery on the Rosebud.

My great-grandfather, Antoine "Chet" DuBray was adopted by the Upper Brule Band on the Rosebud Reservation before his death in 1901. He was also a legally incorporated individual.

### DuBray Ancestry

His father was Antoine DuBreuil, 1797, and his mother was Marie Caillou, 1808-1833, a daughter of Hyacinthe Caillou and Marie-Elizabeth Riddle.

His maternal Grandfather was Louis DuBreuil, 1742-1805, and his grandmother was Marie-Ann Laroche (Briart), a daughter of Louis Laroche (Briart).

Louis DuBreuil was a son of Jean DuBreuil, 1690-1760, and Marie Josephine LaPointe, a daughter of Jean Robin (LaPointe).

Chet DuBray's paternal 2nd great-grandparents and my 5th great-grandparents were, from la Capelle-Biron, Old France, Jacques DuBreuil and Marie Turtonde.

### Chet DuBray's Wives and Children

Beside great-grandma Julia, Chet's other wives were:
- Theresa Latina, one of the younger sisters of Louisson LeCompte
- Louise Robinson, d. 1874
- Jennie Bissonette, 1849-1940

**Theresa Latina's children with Chet DuBray:**
- Joseph DuBray, 1857-1913 (Mary Narcelle, Her Wall, Bobtailed Beaver Woman or Martha Shield, Hopkins, Anna Pleets, 1872-1948)
- With Owen McKenzie: Patrick McKenzie, 1850-1897 (Prue, Esther Mille or Tracks, 1859-1926)

**Louise Robinson's children:**

- Jennie DuBray, 1870-1921 (Clarence Three Stars)
- Elizabeth DuBray, 1872 (William Brown, 1872)
- Charlie DuBray, 1870 (Elizabeth Kills Enemy, 1877)

**Jenny Bissonette's children:**
- Josephine DuBray, 1881 (Price)
- Peter DuBray, 1882-1957 (Lillian Rice, 1891-1959)
- John DuBray, 1885-1955 (Annie Jennie Moran, 1898-1970)

- Lucy DuBray, 1893 (Sturdevant)
- Robert DuBray, 1894-1988 (Olive Bjerkseth, 1899-1979)

I have limited records of these brothers and sisters of Grandma Ducheneaux and know a very few of their descendants. (The DuBrays of this reservation are not DuBrays, they are DuPres).

## Theresa Latina's Children with Papineau

Great-great-aunt Theresa Latina's children with old Papineau were:
- Louisa DuCharme, 1863-1926 (George Cummings, 1862-1929)
- Maggie DuCharme, 1867-1891 (Oscar "Pat" Cummings, 1870-1952)

- Frank DuCharme, 1870-1935 (Alvina Turgeon, 1878-1948)
- Charlie DuCharme, 1871-1934 (Mary Louise Laundreaux, 1871-1909, Mollie Bruguier, 1868-1913, Christine Oversett, 1874-1958)
- John DuCharme, 1875-1951 (youngest son of Papineau)

## Napoleon Ducheneaux's Ancestry

Napoleon Ducheneaux's father was Francois-Xavier Duchesneau, 1812-1845, his mother was Julia Malet. His maternal grandparents were Guillaume Malet and Veronique Pilon.

Great-great-grandfather Francois' father was Thomas Duchesneau, 1778-1832, his mother, Julia or Angelique LaLonde, her parents were Francois LaLonde and Genevieve Chamaillard.

Joseph Duchesneau, 1738-1809, and Marie Proulx, 1745, were the parents of Thomas. His maternal grandparents were, Jacques Proulx and Suzanne Villeray.

Joseph's parents were, Jacques Duchesneau, 1699-1747, and Marie-Francoise Lauze, 1706-1788, her parents were, Paul Lauze and Catherine LeDoux.

Jacques' father, Napoleon's paternal 3rd great-grandfather and my 6th was Rene Duchesneau or Sans Regret, 1665-1740, the husband of Jeanne Guerin, 1676-1743, whose parent's were, Clement Guerin and Perrine Corrier.

### Rene Duchesneau (Sans Regret)

Rene Duchesneau was a French soldier sent to this Continent, ca 1687, when he was about 22 years old, from the tiny village of Fleure (Vienne) in Old France to fight the English and Indians in defense of French interests.

He took the name Sans Regret, or Without Remorse, to protect himself from reprisals by the Indians. After his discharge he became a farmer and re-adopted his true name.

All of the above-named Duchesneaux were born and pretty much raised in the Montreal area.

According to Marcel Gauthier of Iberville, Quebec, the husband of my 5th cousin once removed, Gisele Duchesneau, there is Huron Indian blood in the Duchesneau family.

As I have read, in the early days all the tribes addressed each other as brother. The Hurons, and only the Hurons, were addressed by the others as grandfather - even by the Sioux.

Anyway, Sans Regret's father, the Great-grand daddy of us all, or the Sieur, or Tunka'sila, was Pierre Duchesneau of Poiters, France, loving husband, no doubt, of Marie-Charlotte Roy.

This couple did not come to the "Nouvelle France," they lived in Old France. Pierre was a Royal Sergeant in the Parish of St Michel of Poiters. They both deceased on January 30, 1695.

## Napoleon Ducheneaux's Life

Napoleon Ducheneaux came into the Upper Missouri country from parts unknown.

Dad told me that old Grandpa Nap had told him once that he'd run away from home with Alexander Laundreaux, 1833-1916, as young boys and then apparently separated and went their own ways.

The family of great-uncle Doug Ducheneaux of Promise has a letter penned in French, dated in 1876, to Napoleon from a brother in Corrine, Utah called Charlie Ducheneaux.

His Canadian name was Cajetan Duchesneau, 1837. He was Napoleon's youngest surviving brother. He was raising 1100 head of cattle and operating a livery barn in Corrine.

He wrote about home and an older female relative. I kind of somehow have the idea, maybe I read it, that their mother, Julia died when they were fairly young.

If that was true, I wonder who this woman was.

She was probably one or the other of Napoleon's two older sisters, Julie Ducheneaux, 1824-1901 (Denis DuFort), or Marcelline Duchesneau, 1828-1901 (Pierre Dansereau).

Charlie also wrote about coming to the Black Hills to profit from the gold miners.

He ended his letter with, "I am for life, your brother."

But I guess Napoleon instead joined his older brother Camille Duchesneau, 1832, in the Montana gold fields hauling freight by team and wagon for a while up the mountains to the miners.

Oral family history says then, probably sometime between 1850 and 1860, he fought a man and thinking he had killed him went on across the Rocky Mountains to the northwestern Pacific coast.

Then on down to the California gold fields.

From there he took ship, sailing down around the Horn through the Strait of Magellan and on up the eastern coast of South America across the Gulf of Mexico into the Port of New Orleans.

How long was his odyssey or what he lived, no one knows.

From New Orleans he moved up river to St. Louis and somehow or the other got mixed up in America's civil war. His conduct in that affair as a soldier for the northern States is unknown.

And then he worked his way on up to Swan's Ranch where he bought Sophie, age 16, from Louisson.

Whether or not he was in the company of Alex Laundreaux in his travels and travails is unknown. There is an apparent census record of Nap in the California gold fields, but none of Alex.

## Molly Cika (Little Molly)

I want to clear something up at this point that bothers me every time I read it.

Alex Laundreaux's first and elder wife on the Upper Missouri was Heart Woman, d. 1875, her sister-wife was Her Pretty Hair Horse or Little Molly, 1852-1952, or as they called her, Molly Cika.

I have read more than once that her name was Mole Ciga or some such thing. It was not! There are no two such words in the Sioux language.

She took or was given the Christian name Molly. She was a very small woman. To differentiate from the many other Sioux women named Molly, they called her Little Molly.

In the Sioux language, the word "little" is cikala, a shortened form of cikala is cika. She was therefore called Molly Cika.

Her parents were, according to Indian Bureau probate records, Louis Obachon or Aubachon and Red Hair Woman. She was raised, until Laundreaux bought her at age 14, by her maternal grandfather Swift Cloud.

Somebody said that Napoleon Ducheneaux and Alexander Laundreaux were related.

## Bazille Claymore (1824-1910)

Now comes Bazille Claymore, 1824-1910, a quarter-blood Cree and a French Canadian man from St. Charles, Missouri. But he had been born somewhere in the northern Rocky Mountains.

He arrived at Ft. Pierre on the steamboat Trapper in 1840 at the age of 16 and except for one or two visits to Missouri as a young man just stayed right here for the rest of his life.

He was called Jacques Marie, and he claimed to have toured the Rocky Mountains at age 19 with Jim Bridger and Benito Vasquez fighting Shoshonis, Snakes and Crows, and trappin beaver.

He had plural wives:
- An unknown Sioux woman from the Black Foot Band
- A half-blood Sans Arc named White Woman or Mary Sarpy, 1830-1892
- A full-blood named Ice Woman, d 1864, who was probably Sans Arc as well

I have understood that my great-grandmother, White Woman was a close relative of Ice Woman. Old B.C.'s 4th wife, Red Crane Woman was stolen from him before she could have his children.

He became fluent in the Sioux language and was a trusted iyeska or interpreter for the Sans Arc Band in its dealings with the whites.

His boys were called iyeska cincas or interpreter's sons.

My great-grandfather, Bazille Claymore was adopted by the four bands domiciled on the Cheyenne River Reservation before his death in 1910. He was also a legally incorporated individual.

The Sans Arc called him Nape Sica, or Bad Hand.

He is buried in St. Basil's Catholic Cemetery at Mossman next to Mary Cleymore.

His epitaph reads: *A good and kind father to his children, generous and hospitable to all whites and Indians and with all whom he met while living here. His good qualities of heart will ever be remembered, also for his many kind acts.*

### The Hay Flat Story

He could be ornery though! Babe told me one time that old Beanie had told her that he and his brothers and his dad were making hay one time somewhere up on the Cheyenne River along side another old iyeska and his cincas.

To get their hay home, they both had to cross a deep draw or go to the head of it many miles and back down again by team and hayrack. It must have been a pretty good hay flat.

Claymore finished haying first, so then he and his sons started out building a make-shift bridge across the draw to get his hay to home located just immediately north of the mouth of the Cheyenne River.

In the meantime, the other old iyeska finished his haying, parked his mowers and rakes, unharnessed his teams and sat down with his sons to watch Claymore complete the bridge.

Old B.C. and the boys finished the job, took the hay across, dropped the last load on the bridge, lit it on fire, made sure things were burning damn good and then took the rest of his hay home.

### Bazille Claymore's Ancestry

His father was Antoine Clement, ca 1765-ca 1833, and his mother was a half-blood Cree woman called Lizette, her name was Marie Louise Dumont, ca 1790-ca 1850.

Lizette's father was Jean-Baptiste Dumont, a Trader for the Hudson's Bay Company.

On "the 14th of November, 1826, was married by me the underwritten, Antoine Clement to Lizette in the Parish of St. Ferdinand, St. Louis County ...," the Missouri civil record reads.

Antoine Clement spent his adult life all over the Rocky Mountains, up and down again, for many years before there was too much there but a bunch of mean Indians and some choice beaver pelts.

Parties unknown have maintained that old B.C. was the only son of a Charles Clement of Paris, France and that his mother was a Spanish woman surnamed Rose. There is much evidence to refute that!

It is almost certain that Antoine Clement, headquartered out of Missouri, and Lizette had a son named Bazille Clement who came on the Upper Missouri in 1840 and stayed.

Right now that's the one I claim and I have a grandson named for him.

### Bazille Claymore's Children

**With his Black Foot wife - Alone Young Woman, 1848-1893 (John White Horse or Shinn, 1837-1903):**

Alone Young Woman's children were:
- Frank White Horse, I, 1872-1896 (White Clay Woman, Pacer Woman)
- Gets Off Along Side Him, 1876-1888
- Katie White Horse, 1882-1913 (Edward Spotted Crow, 1878-1951)
- Ties Up A Hundred, 1888-1896
- Frank White Horse, II, 1890 (went to the Crows)
- Strong Legs Woman, d. 1914 (Wolf Looks Up) - possibly from another man

Some of Bazille's Sarpy children did not want Alone Young Woman to be included in his probate, claiming she was not his daughter. But he knew!

The probate testimony in 1919 was that in a camp on the Missouri River he publicly gave her gifts of horses and fine clothing when she was an adolescent to acknowledge her as his daughter.

A surviving son, living with the Crows, and her two granddaughters from Strong Legs Woman were allowed to share in old B.C.'s estate.

**Children with Ice Woman:**
- John or James Claymore, 1853-1858

## Thomas Carter and Kate Carter

Kate was the daughter of my other maternal great-grandfather Thomas Carter, 1850-1888, and a woman named Her Shawl, 1856-1934, who was probably from the Black Foot Band. She was also called Julia and Esther Meeter.

Esther was a daughter of Red Flying, ca 1825-1866, and Red White Buffalo Woman, d 1860. There is some evidence that Red Flying was an Oglala man.
